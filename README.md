# PhoneComparison

### Packages used
URLLIB for http connection, 
SSL for certificates, 
BEAUTIFUL SOUP for html parsing

### How to run on android
Install python3 App on android and install bs4 package, then run the code. 

### How it works
This works on web scraping mechanism in python. Request is sent to get the data of each cricket player. HTML of the cricket page contains the table in which the stats are stored. Using Beautiful Soup package we retrieve data from the table. It is repeated for the other player. The stats are displayed side by side for comparison.

### Future Enhancement
Instead of displaying the statistics of player side by side, a smart comparison should be made. This involves showing of in which metrics the player is good at and other inferences from the data can be retrived.
